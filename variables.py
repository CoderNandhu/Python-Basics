# lets start with variables

# there are rules to declare variable names so consider that in mind 

first_name = "Nandhu" #as you all know we don't need a ; to end the statement like other programming language.
last_name = "Krishnan"

fullName = first_name + last_name #this line will concatinate the the strings or the value present in the variables.

print(fullName) # this line will print the value stored in the variable fullName.

# As we can see the output has no space so we have to include it 
fullName = first_name + " " + last_name
print(fullName)
# just to show the difference between both the outputs you can compare the outputs
